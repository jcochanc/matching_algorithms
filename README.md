# Matching Algorithms

## Matching Algorithms for Causal Inference with Multiple Treatments
Authors: Anthony D. Scotina, Roee Gutman

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are ideal for estimating causal effects, because the distributions of background covariates are
similar in expectation across treatment groups. When estimating causal effects using observational data, matching is a commonly used 
method to replicate the covariate balance achieved in a RCT between two treatment groups. We propose matching algorithms
that address the drawbacks of the current methods, and we use simulations to compare current and new methods. All of the methods display improved covariate 
balance in the matched sets relative to the pre-matched cohorts. In addition, we provide advice to investigators on which matching 
algorithms are preferred for different covariate distributions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
